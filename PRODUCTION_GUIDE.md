## 🚀 How to Run as EXE

### Option 1: Fix CGO and Build EXE (Recommended)

1. **Install MinGW Compiler**:
   ```
   Download: https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/
   Install: Choose "Add to PATH" option
   Restart: Close and reopen terminal
   ```

2. **Build the EXE**:
   ```cmd
   # GUI version (no console)
   go build -ldflags "-s -w -H=windowsgui" -o NullInstaller.exe .
   
   # Console version (with debug output) 
   go build -ldflags "-s -w" -o NullInstaller-console.exe .
   ```

3. **Run the EXE**:
   ```cmd
   .\NullInstaller.exe
   ```

### Option 2: Use Go Run (Alternative)

If you can't install MinGW, run directly from source:

```cmd
# Method 1: Use the script
.\run.bat

# Method 2: Direct command
go run .
```

## 🔧 Alternative Deployment Options

### Pre-built EXE Approach:
If you have access to a Windows machine with MinGW:
1. Install TDM-GCC on that machine
2. Copy the source files
3. Build the EXE there
4. Copy the built EXE back

### Docker Approach:
Use a Windows container with Go + MinGW pre-installed:
```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.22-windowsservercore
RUN # Install MinGW in container
COPY . .
RUN go build -ldflags "-s -w -H=windowsgui" -o NullInstaller.exe .
```
